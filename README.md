Hello there,
            Ignore this. this repository is only for my streak maintainance. 
            I chose to create this repository on 18th August 2025, when i realized that my longest GitHub Streak was broken on 16th Aug 2025 when I was "1" minute late and Github registered that as 17th's contribution instead of 16th.

From now on, 
    I will be adding 1-3 lines in this repository daily. 
# Just to maintain my streak...


I Strongly suggest you check out my other repositories instead of this one.

I have started working on a Python PDF application that will enable users to merge multiple PDF files, display pages visually, and perform basic annotations and edits such as highlighting and adding comments. The project will
use libraries like PyPDF2 for merging, PyMuPDF for rendering and annotating, and optionally ReportLab for simple content edits.

I plan to build the app modularly, beginning with core functions like merging and viewing PDFs, then gradually adding annotation and editing features. The user interface will be developed last to integrate all functionalities
smoothly. I will post regular updates on the progress and enhancements of this project.

I will be publishing my portfolio on the site soon. The portfolio will be complete with my certifications and projects.

Update: I have created my first portfolio website using tools like lovable.dev and have built my information on its output. 

I have deployed the code to a new repository named Portfolio in my GitHub account. have deployed it as a site to vercel.com and have added it as a sub-domain to "pvk.net.in". 

The website link is: "portfolio.pvk.net.in". 

The backend is not yet complete. I will be working on it later on.

Today I plan on reviving one of my dead projects. 
The name of the project is HORUS. It is a remastered version of Linux that I have initially planned to release in March of 2025, but has scrapped it due to some issues. 
I plan on redoing this starting it from scratch. I will be posting all the updates here.
