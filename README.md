Hello there,
            Ignore this. this repository is only for my streak maintainance. 
            I chose to create this repository on 18th August 2025, when i realized that my longest GitHub Streak was broken on 16th Aug 2025 when I was "1" minute late and Github registered that as 17th's contribution instead of 16th.

From now on, 
    I will be adding 1-3 lines in this repository daily. 
# Just to maintain my streak...


I Strongly suggest you check out my other repositories instead of this one.

I have started working on a Python PDF application that will enable users to merge multiple PDF files, display pages visually, and perform basic annotations and edits such as highlighting and adding comments. The project will
use libraries like PyPDF2 for merging, PyMuPDF for rendering and annotating, and optionally ReportLab for simple content edits.

I plan to build the app modularly, beginning with core functions like merging and viewing PDFs, then gradually adding annotation and editing features. The user interface will be developed last to integrate all functionalities
smoothly. I will post regular updates on the progress and enhancements of this project.
