Hello there,
            Ignore this. this repository is only for my streak maintainance. 
            I chose to create this repository on 18th August 2025, when i realized that my longest GitHub Streak was broken on 16th Aug 2025 when I was "1" minute late and Github registered that as 17th's contribution instead of 16th.

From now on, 
    I will be adding 1-3 lines in this repository daily. 
# Just to maintain my streak...


I Strongly suggest you check out my other repositories instead of this one.

I have started working on a Python PDF application that will enable users to merge multiple PDF files, display pages visually, and perform basic annotations and edits such as highlighting and adding comments. The project will
use libraries like PyPDF2 for merging, PyMuPDF for rendering and annotating, and optionally ReportLab for simple content edits.

I plan to build the app modularly, beginning with core functions like merging and viewing PDFs, then gradually adding annotation and editing features. The user interface will be developed last to integrate all functionalities
smoothly. I will post regular updates on the progress and enhancements of this project.

Update: Today I have bought a custom domain. It is "pvk.net.in"
I will be publishing my portfolio on the site soon. The portfolio will be complete with my certifications and projects.



21-08-2025:

Update: I have created my first portfolio website using tools like lovable.dev and have built my information on its output. 

I have deployed the code to a new repository named Portfolio in my GitHub account. have deployed it as a site to vercel.com and have added it as a sub-domain to "pvk.net.in". 

The website link is: "portfolio.pvk.net.in". 

The backend is not yet complete. I will be working on it later on.

Today I plan on reviving one of my dead projects. 
The name of the project is HORUS. It is a remastered version of Linux that I have initially planned to release in March of 2025, but has scrapped it due to some issues. 
I plan on redoing this starting it from scratch. I will be posting all the updates here.

The time right now is around 12.45AM.
I had to work to now because I messed up big time, trying to set up more space for Windows operating system. I could've played out safe and done it way faster but I didn't. But honestly this was a great experience. 
After a long thought process, I have decided the base of HORUS OS will be Arch Linux. I have chosen it due to its stability. 
I will update more about this in the morning. Gn üôè

Update: I have settled for MX Linux as the base as opposed to the initial thought of Arch Liunx as the base. I have changed this due to MX Linux having  a larger base of tools, support and beginner friendly experience, and since the targeted user base of HORUS being students who do not like complex first distributions. 
I have Finished a day-to-day plan ( a roadmap of sorts) for this project that allows me to stay focused. It is a 10-day plan that involves various steps from customizing to addingmy own tools.
I will be updating this documents to share the progress of my project.

UPDATE:
Today I have shortlisted a small list of apps that I plan on including in HORUS. Since the targeted audience/users for this project is students, I chose mainly free or/and Open-Source Apps.
This list includes apps like:
LibreOffice Suite.
Okular.
FOSS Browser (Chromium)
etc.

UPDATE:
I have also started a small new project, I have decided to host a simple chat-bot connected to Google Dialogflow to a sub-domain in pvk.net.in (something like: chat.pvk.net.in)
The Dialogflow bot has so many answers to questions regarding me. Like my projects certifications and more. Since this is a fairly small project, I intend on completing this project this week.
Will update reqularly.
