Hello there,
            This repository is  my journal where I update my day to day journey of learning and creating.
            I chose to create this repository on 18th August 2025, when i realized that my longest GitHub Streak was broken on 16th Aug 2025 when I was "1" minute late and Github registered that as 17th's contribution instead of 16th.

From now on, 
    I will be adding 1-3 lines in this repository daily, only about my journey and problems in that journey.

I Strongly suggest you check out my other repositories instead of this one.

# August 2025

19-08-2025:
            
I have started working on a Python PDF application that will enable users to merge multiple PDF files, display pages visually, and perform basic annotations and edits such as highlighting and adding comments. The project will
use libraries like PyPDF2 for merging, PyMuPDF for rendering and annotating, and optionally ReportLab for simple content edits.

I plan to build the app modularly, beginning with core functions like merging and viewing PDFs, then gradually adding annotation and editing features. The user interface will be developed last to integrate all functionalities
smoothly. I will post regular updates on the progress and enhancements of this project.


20-08-2025:

Update: Today I have bought a custom domain. It is "pvk.net.in"
I will be publishing my portfolio on the site soon. The portfolio will be complete with my certifications and projects.



21-08-2025:

Update: I have created my first portfolio website using tools like lovable.dev and have built my information on its output. 

I have deployed the code to a new repository named Portfolio in my GitHub account. have deployed it as a site to vercel.com and have added it as a sub-domain to "pvk.net.in". 

The website link is: "portfolio.pvk.net.in". 

The backend is not yet complete. I will be working on it later on. 


22-08-2025:
Today I plan on reviving one of my dead projects. 
The name of the project is HORUS. It is a remastered version of Linux that I have initially planned to release in March of 2025, but has scrapped it due to some issues. 
I plan on redoing this starting it from scratch. I will be posting all the updates here.

23-08-2025: 
The time right now is around 12.45AM.
I had to work to now because I messed up big time, trying to set up more space for Windows operating system. I could've played out safe and done it way faster but I didn't. But honestly this was a great experience. 
After a long thought process, I have decided the base of HORUS OS will be Arch Linux. I have chosen it due to its stability. 
I will update more about this in the morning. Gn üôè

Update: I have settled for MX Linux as the base as opposed to the initial thought of Arch Liunx as the base. I have changed this due to MX Linux having  a larger base of tools, support and beginner friendly experience, and since the targeted user base of HORUS being students who do not like complex first distributions. 
I have Finished a day-to-day plan ( a roadmap of sorts) for this project that allows me to stay focused. It is a 10-day plan that involves various steps from customizing to addingmy own tools.
I will be updating this documents to share the progress of my project.

24-08-2025:
UPDATE:
Today I have shortlisted a small list of apps that I plan on including in HORUS. Since the targeted audience/users for this project is students, I chose mainly free or/and Open-Source Apps.
This list includes apps like:
LibreOffice Suite.
Okular.
FOSS Browser (Chromium)
etc.

UPDATE:
I have also started a small new project, I have decided to host a simple chat-bot connected to Google Dialogflow to a sub-domain in pvk.net.in (something like: chat.pvk.net.in)
The Dialogflow bot has so many answers to questions regarding me. Like my projects certifications and more. Since this is a fairly small project, I intend on completing this project this week.
Will update reqularly.

25-08-2025:
Today I have made some progress on designing my Chat Bot website. 
I have gone with static web design to keep it as light as possible. 
I have created an agent, given it around 20 intents and trained it on generic professional questions. I have also trained the agent on small talk since dialogflow has so many small talk questions pre-built. 
Tomorrow I will have to integrate the agent to my website, test it and deploy. 
will update tomorrow

26-08-2025:
Today, I have not done much. But I took my time retraining the bot again with even more training phrases and responses.
I will be doing some work on HORUS forthe day, I will have to run some scripts( that are my own) regardingvarious purposes.
I will be updating once that is done...

27-08-2025:
UPDATE:
Today, I was not able to put in any real work, and my subdomain( portfolio.pvk.net.in) is not working, I have not been able to assess the problem and find the cause of it.
I will find the cause and resolve it tommorow.
I will be working tommorow, since this day is over.

28-08-2025:
Today, I have not done any major work(Like yesterday) Since I was researching the 2025 Smart India Hackathon Problem Statements. 
I have found Some Interesting ones, There is a meeting at 9:00 pm today with my hackathon team and I have 3 Problem Statements that I have found Interesting more than the others. I will pitch them to my team. 
They will have some of their own statements. So, I will be updating after the meeting.

29-08-2025:
We chose the statement 25076:
A chatbot for farmers, It has t give them suggestions for their crops and more. 
It might be challenging, We'll have to try.
Now to my projects, I am trying to generate the ASCII art for the logo of horus. It is quite challenging, I have written a python script for this job, It is not working how i want that to. I'll be doing this today

30-08-2025:
Today, I have created an app in uxccelerate.ai for it's VibeHack 2025.
the app is a better version of AeroCode available on my github page with the same name.
I have submitted it and do not know what will happen.

31-08-2025:
Today I have faced a major issue with HORUS. I do not know what went wrong but it is not working. I tried rebooting but it doesn't even boot up anymore. 

I think I'll have to do so the things from start again. This has happened multiple times in the past. That is the main reason I have scrapped this project in the past. 
I will try to do this two more times and if this happens again, I would ultimately scrap the project and move on. 
Also, I bought home a small turtle yesterday, I named it OOGWAY.
that's it for today. I will try again and update



# SEPTEMBER 2025:
01-09-2025:
Today I had installed MX LINUX for HORUS. I have done the basic things and an getting started with that again. 
I will be advancing tomorrow. 
I will update once I have started

02-09-2025:
Today I had a really great session with Sri. Gampa Nageswara Rao Sir, He is the founder of Impact Club International. 
The session was so great, I have learned so much about the today's world and how to advance in it. I loved that session.
Since there were very limited people, I was able to talk to him and he has given me some advice regarding my education, and how I can improve my concentration.
As for my projects and all, I have not put any work today due to the lack of time.
I willhave to start HORUS tommorow.
I will update once i have started.

03-09-2025:
Today, I have joined another hackathon conducted by our college. 
The team for this hackathon is the same as the team I was in for SIH.
Also I have reinstalled all the necessary applications for HORUS. I hope to succeed this time. I have created a plan for 7 days regarding this project. If I succeed, I will be very happy. 
I will share that plan here tomorrow after finalizing that.
I will update tomorrow.

04-09-2025:
Today I made a complete fool of myself in front of my whole class. 
One of my teachers had asked me to list my projects and achievements to interview us. 
He did that to give worthy students a chance to work with him and publish some papers. 
That would've been a great opportunity for me if not for that embarrassment. 
I listed some of my projects and I was literally shaking with dear during that time. He asked me to elaborate about my Machine Learning project which I was unable to do because of the fear and embarrassment.
He ultimately did not give me the chance and I do not feel so good about that. 
I wish I had that chance to work with him and build my skills.
As for my projects, I tried HORUS again only to get the same result. 
I am thinking of scraping to forever. or atleast I get some guidance and restart it. 


05-09-2025:
Today is a holiday and I got a chance to do one final run on HORUS so I booted up the virtual machine with yesterday's version. 
I thought it would work if I try and repair it but I was unlucky as it didn't work. 
I have scrapped to and am thinking of meeting one of our college teachers for some guidance. 
The professor I am thinking of meeting haa already made an operating system for our college. So I think he might help me. I am nervous about meeting him. 
Also, today is the first day of a 5-day OSINT Bootcamp. I am fascinated by that subject so I figured I'd learn the basics. 
Tomorrow there is a GDG meet in our college about vibe coding. 
I've been doing that for quite some time now but I want to learn more about it that I might not know. so I enrolled for that too.
I'll update after these sessions.

Update: I have started a new project today. 
NoteNest:
A user-friendly and lightweight notepad app for quick, organized note-taking and Code editing.

06-09-2025:
Today I have attended the GOOGLE DEVELOPER GROUPS event in our college. It was a great experience. 
Even though I have used the tools before today, I have learnt so much more. 
Before coming home I met the teacher that rejected me saying my experience is not good, I'v e shown him the projects I did and he is giving me a chance I think...
That's it for today, I will update once something happened

07-09-2025:
Today was a good day, I have used the Gemini CLI tool to create a notepad app that I've mentioned before
NoteNest is actually done, I will upload the code to GitHub.
There are some more things to do on that, so I will upload after that.
I have added features like syntax highlghting for multiple languages in this.
there also is so much to explore, so I will upload the code as V1.0 and upload the next version after adding all the other features.

08-09-2025:
Today is a bad day since I have not put in any real work.
I was a bit preoccupied with SIH work.
That's it for today. I will update tomorrow.
UPDATE: I have developed a simple prototype for KrishiSetu.
I have uploaded it to GitHub. Check it out at https://github.com/pvk-96/KrishiSetu-Prototype

09-09-2025:
Today was a somewhat wasted day.
the whole day I was working on SIH work. 
We have created a prototype, created presentation recorded videos regarding the presentation, edited those videos and all just for the deadline to be extended. 
Tomorrow will be spent on Sankalp Hackathon. I am unable to focus on my projects because of this. 
I will update with any interesting things.

10-09-2025:
Today was the last day for ppt submission for our college hackathon. 

We chose
‚ÄúA silent crisis exists ‚Äî millions of children with learning disabilities remain unseen, while thousands of professionals remain underutilized.‚Äù

The Numbers Speak:Over 30 million people in India live with learning disabilities, with 3.5 lakh children aged 0‚Äì17 in need of immediate support.
The Hidden Gap:Ironically, while children require timely intervention and therapy, thousands ‚Äî if not lakhs ‚Äî of trained therapists struggle to find patients.
The Root Cause:This mismatch is not due to a lack of professionals, but due to low awareness, stigma, and lack of early detection.
The Impact:Children lose valuable years of learning, confidence, and growth, creating long-term social and emotional consequences.

this as our problem statement. the SIH deadline has been extended to tomorrow. so our group has to re-record our presentation video.
due to being occupied with this, I am unable to focus on my project. I'll update tomorrow.

11-09-2025:
Today We have submitted the SIH presentation.
I have uploaded the files of NoteNest to a repository named NoteNest. Altough the app is Vibe-Coded, I am working on my own version using python.
I think that would help me learn more.
That's It for today, I'll update tommorow.

12-09-2025:
Today I ran into a problem.
I do not know what happened but my arch linux distro stopped working.
All of my work is in that. I have been working to fix that. I do not know what to do. 
I will update once i have resolved it and specify the problem.

14-09-2025:
I have lost my GitHub streak again. I lost my 27 day streak on 13-09-2025 because I was caught up in my own works. I'll have to rebuild the streak day by day again. 
From now on I will update this repository daily with something useful.
